## ðŸ“š Overview and Structure
* This project consists of two screens, first one displaying multiple crypto coin data fetched from a certain `json` endpoint, while the other screen displays the line graph between `coin value` and `datetime` of a coin along with `coinID` which is being passed from screen 1 to screen 2.
* `[slug].js` is used to create dynamic routes for displaying Line Chart and different Coin IDs based upon user selection.
* Using `getServerSideProps` (in `slug` route) & `getStaticProps` (in `/` route) methods provided by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), asynchronous calls to the endpoint are being made for better efficiency of the website.
* Coin Name & Coin ID are being passed to screen 2 (`slug` route) via props in components.
* Screen 1 lists only 10 coins per page, and pagination (`components/Pagination.js`) is implemented.
* A simple search bar for filtering only those Coins per page.
